Validation Error: [ VUID-vkCmdDraw-None-08600 ] Object 0: handle = 0x4fac1c0000000032, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_PIPELINE; Object 1: handle = 0x4b7df1000000002f, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_PIPELINE_LAYOUT; | MessageID = 0x4768cf39 | vkCmdDraw(): The VkPipeline 0x4fac1c0000000032[] (created with VkPipelineLayout 0x4b7df1000000002f[]) statically uses descriptor set (index #1) which is not compatible with the currently bound descriptor set's pipeline layout (VkPipelineLayout 0x4b7df1000000002f[]) The Vulkan spec states: For each set n that is statically used by a bound shader, a descriptor set must have been bound to n at the same pipeline bind point, with a VkPipelineLayout that is compatible for set n, with the VkPipelineLayout or VkDescriptorSetLayout array that was used to create the current VkPipeline or VkShaderEXT, as described in Pipeline Layout Compatibility (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VUID-vkCmdDraw-None-08600)
